    We met back in Class 10 — just classmates at first,
    unaware that those random conversations, shared benches,
    silly laughs, and stressful exams were laying the foundation
    for something so real.
    From notebooks to memories, from school days to now,
    you’ve been a constant presence in my life.
    Some friendships don’t fade with time — they grow stronger.
    And you, Devendra, are proof of that 🫂💙

  <h2 class="neon-text">Always Remember This 💫</h2>

  <p class="para">
    You’re not just my best friend.  
    You’re my comfort zone, my chaos partner,
    and someone I’ll always be grateful for.
    No matter where life takes us,
    you’ll always have a special place in my heart.
    Happy Birthday, Devendra 💙
